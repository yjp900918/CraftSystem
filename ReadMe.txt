This is a simple craft system. In my setting, use a bronze sword and a silver sword to craft a golden sword.
When running, you should first check the box of Is Crafting in DB.
Then enter the ID of items to add items into slots.
bronze sword ID: 1
silver sword ID: 2

For example:
Enter "1" in a input field and enter "2" in another input field, it will create a golden sword in the larger slots.
